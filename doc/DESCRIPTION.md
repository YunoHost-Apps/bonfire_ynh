Bonfire is a federated social app built for people and communities who care about autonomy, meaningful connection, and healthy online spaces. It offers familiar features like feeds and profiles — but goes further with powerful tools for customization, moderation, and control, so you can shape your digital space to fit your needs. Bonfire is also a gateway into the broader fediverse — a network of independent, interconnected apps — while staying fully self-hostable and community-governed.
